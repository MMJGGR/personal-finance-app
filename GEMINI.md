## üéØ Objective

Rebuild the Profile & Risk Module from the ground up as the central orchestration engine for every financial and personal data point in the app. It must:

- Ingest, version and expose personal details, financial streams, life events and behavioral insights.
- Drive all other features (Income, Expenses, Goals, Balance Sheet, Planning) through a single source of truth.
- Adapt dynamically to any individual‚Äôs circumstances at different life stages, without hard‚Äëcoding for one persona.
- Support progressive profiling, allowing data to be added, updated or rolled back without losing history.
- Align with CFA phases (Accumulation ‚Üí Transition ‚Üí Distribution) and enterprise‚Äëgrade best practices.

---

## üîÑ Dynamic, Multi‚ÄëPersona Architecture

Rather than customizing for a single user, the module must be flexible enough to:

- Accept an unlimited variety of personas, each defined by demographic data, financial streams, life events and risk preferences.
- Load, update and version snapshots of a persona‚Äôs profile so that past and present states remain accessible.
- Drive personalized insights and recommendations based on any combination of fields.

### Key Capabilities

- **Schema‚Äëdriven fields**: Define a JSON schema for each category of data (personal, financial, behavioral, events). Use validation to enforce types and ranges.
- **Version control**: Automatically create a new profile snapshot whenever any field is added or updated. Maintain an audit trail.
- **Event timeline**: Allow users or advisors to insert major life events (marriage, job change, health shock, inheritance) with dates and optional metadata.
- **Data orchestration**: Expose an API for other modules to subscribe to profile changes and recalculate PVs, cash‚Äëflow projections and risk scores in real time.

## üìö Profile Components (Prose + Point Form)

**1. Personal Information**
- Fields: full name, birth date, gender, marital status, dependents count and ages, education level, residential status.
- Use cases: age for lifecycle mapping; marital status and dependents for expense modeling; education and literacy as proxies for financial sophistication.

**2. Financial Streams**
- Income: salary, bonuses, business revenue, rental, dividends, pension, irregular windfalls.
- Assets & Liabilities: deposit accounts, investments, real estate, mortgages, credit lines, loans, credit cards.
- Integration: feed each stream into PV calculators, emergency fund calculators, debt amortization schedules and allocation engines.

**3. Behavioral & Risk Profile**
- Multi‚Äëstep questionnaire aligned with CFA guidelines: tolerance, capacity, objectives.
- Store raw answers and compute normalized scores on the fly.
- Tie responses to event triggers and dynamic nudges (e.g., revisit risk profile after a major shock).

**4. Life Events Timeline**
- Users can add or select predefined events: marriage, children, home purchase, divorce, career change, illness, retirement.
- Each event can carry quantitative impacts: income change, expense shift, tax bracket adjustments.
- Timeline drives scenario analysis and ‚Äúwhat‚Äëif‚Äù projections.

**5. Progressive Versioning & Audit**
- Every profile update (manual or system‚Äëdriven) creates a new version.
- Users or QA can roll back to any previous snapshot if errors are found.
- Exportable change log with timestamps, user IDs and field deltas.

**6. Wealth Lifecycle Visualization**
- A dedicated screen (or tab) displays a lifetime graph: net worth over age, income vs expenses vs savings rate.
- Overlay phases: Accumulation (rising net worth), Transition (plateau), Distribution (drawdown).
- Interactive: hover for details, zoom on specific decades.

## üõ† Implementation Checklist

1. **Scaffold Core Module**
   - Define JSON schemas for each profile category.
   - Build Context/Store to hold current profile object + version history.
   - Implement validation and default values.

2. **Personal Data Forms**
   - Create form components for each field group.
   - Wire updates to versioned store.
   - Add inline validation and autosave on blur.

3. **Financial Streams Integration**
   - Build inputs for each stream type with date ranges and amounts.
   - Hook into PV and projection utilities.
   - Ensure real‚Äëtime recalculations in linked modules.

4. **Risk & Behavioral Engine**
   - Develop wizard UI for questionnaire.
   - Compute normalized scores; store both answers and scores.
   - Expose event triggers based on answers (e.g., low capacity ‚Üí suggest debt reduction).

5. **Event Timeline**
   - Implement a dynamic timeline UI with drag/drop events.
   - Link each event to quantitative effects on cash flows.

6. **Versioning & Audit Trail**
   - Auto‚Äëversion on every store change.
   - Build audit viewer component.
   - Add ability to revert to prior version.

7. **Visualization**
   - Create the Wealth Lifecycle graph using a chart library.
   - Integrate interactive timeline controls.

8. **Testing & QA**
   - Unit tests for schema validation, versioning, score computation.
   - Integration tests for data flow across Profile ‚Üí Income/Expenses/Goals.
   - UI acceptance: form navigation, autosave, timeline interactions, graph rendering.

## üß™ QA Test Plan

- Validate schema enforcement (missing fields, type mismatches).
- Confirm version history accuracy and revert functionality.
- Test cash flow recalculations after manual profile edits and events.
- Verify risk score updates and behavioral triggers under multiple scenarios.
- Ensure wealth graph updates accurately as profile data changes.
- Cross‚Äëmodule tests: Income tab reflects salary edits; Expenses tab picks up new dependents; Goals tab recalculates education cost.
