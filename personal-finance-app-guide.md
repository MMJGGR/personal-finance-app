# Persona Data

Earlier versions of the app shipped with multiple sample personas and a dropdown
for switching between them. The current build still includes **Hadi** by
default but you can now add your own personas from the sidebar. Use **Add
Persona** to create a blank profile and **Remove Persona** to delete the current
one.

1. **Start the App**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
2. **Work with the Data**
   All tabs load Hadi's information automatically. Any changes you make are
   stored in local storage. Use the **Reset to Defaults** button on the Profile
   tab to restore the bundled data.
3. **Exporting**
   When exporting JSON or CSV files, Hadiâ€™s name is included in the filename
   (e.g. `income-data-Hadi_Alsawad.json`).
