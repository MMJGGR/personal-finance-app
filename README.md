# Personal Finance App

This web application helps you manage your finances by tracking income, expenses and goals. Use the different tabs to add new transactions, review your balance sheet and update your profile or settings. Recurring expenses are entered in the **Expenses** section. One-off outflows should be added as **Goals** so they can be planned for a specific year.
